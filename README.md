# hello-world
welcome to GitHub tutorial

I am a mechanical engineer and an accounting student who is interested in writing software.
I started my C++ journey back in high school, and also took the C++ and Data Structures/Algorithms series in college.
I haven't used C++ in over 10 years, and am working on removing my rust, and bringing my code up to current standards.
This hub will document my journey and serve as a repository for a portfolio.
